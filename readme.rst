Unish - One Configuration To Rule Them All
==========================================


Hopefully it will come true in ten years. :)


Current State: Public Testing With Primitive Features.


Features
--------

- Logging Layer

- Builtin Help Layer

  Created by a previous Bash user
  who missed that handy ``help`` builtin.

- Documentation generator (Ongoing)

  Will be built by someone who denounced documentation with no code.

- Plugin Layer (Planned)


Installation
------------

Clone this repository recursively,
backup your original ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc if necessary,
and then use the included ``makefile`` to prepare symbolic links.

And you are done.


Bundled Packages

- zsh & bash

  - `virtualenvwrapper / virtualenvwrapper <https://bitbucket.org/virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper>`_ MIT
