Unish - One Configuration To Rule Them All
==========================================


Hopefully it will come true in ten years. :)


Current State: Public Testing With Primitive Features.


Features
--------

- Logging Layer

- Builtin Help Layer

  Created by a previous Bash user
  who missed that handy ``help`` builtin.

- Plugin Layer (Planned)


Installation
------------

Backup your original ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc if necessary,
and then use the included ``makefile`` to prepare symbolic links.

And you are done.


Contribution
------------

Feature requests (e.g. Shell functions to get your work done)
and integration of your own useful shell functions
are welcome.
